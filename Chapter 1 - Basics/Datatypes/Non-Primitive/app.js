// Non-Primitive Data Types
// Non-primitive data types (or reference types) are more complex data structures. They include objects, arrays, and functions.

// 1. Object: Represents a collection of properties, each with a key and a value.

let person = {
    name: "Alice",
    age: 30
};

// 2. Array: A special type of object that represents an ordered collection of values.

let colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];

// 3. Function: A reusable block of code designed to perform a particular task. Functions are also objects in JavaScript.

function greet(name) {
    return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

// 4. Date: Represents date and time.

let currentDate = new Date();

// 5. RegExp: Represents regular expressions, used for pattern matching in strings.

let regex = /ab+c/;
